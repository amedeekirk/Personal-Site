# Personal Site
Version 4 of my personal website, now with SASS!

## About
Welcome to my website code/personal playground area! This site has been developed by me for two reasons:
- Showcase what I know, have done, and what I'm about
- Operate as a testing field for new web technology  that I'm learning

## Running Locally
If you want to run this repository on your personal machine (for whatever reason) or want to learn about my workflow, Note these steps:

1. Download and open the project however you see fit
2. Run `npm install` in both the base directory as well as in /client (Assuming you have Node.js installed) (You probably do if you're reading this tbh)
3. Run `mpm start` from the base directory. The site will start on localhost:8000
4. If you want to make edits to the SASS code, be sure to run `npm run compile-sass` in another terminal from the /client directory. It will continue to watch for updates as you save.


## Improvement ideas?
Have a suggestion, point of confusion, or bug to share? Do not hesitate to post it in the [issues section of this project](https://github.com/amedeekirk/amedeekirk.github.io/issues). I'll be the first to admit that not everything is as perfect as it can be, and I am but a mere junior developer. Thus, I'd love to hear your feedback!

## Not used anymore but of note
I pull my backgrounds form [here](http://imgur.com/a/NwYZq) and my music from [here](https://soundcloud.com/amedee-kirkpatrick-607716013/sets/playlist-converter). Both are my personal accounts but I do not own the content.
