I later developed it into just a frontend application, utilizing Vue and Node.js.

It features account creation, manual and automated image screening, and the ability for admins to easily manage stored images and handle previously mentioned reports. I primarily worked on the admin and user account endpoints, though all of us essentially had a hand in every aspect of the project. I also provided the dog images used for testing.",

This prevented users from having to download a video onto their computer in order to watch it, which I personally found to be a hassle. Due to Discord now supporting an embedded video player natively, this project is unfortunately now obsolete",
