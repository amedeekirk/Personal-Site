I worked alongside Nick Orrell to redesign, deploy, and create a website for a more straightforward and intuitive take on what was formerly a school project. I also provided many of the dog images used for testing.",

This prevented users from having to download a video onto their computer in order to watch it, which I personally found to be a hassle. Due to Discord now supporting an embedded video player natively, this project is unfortunately now obsolete",
